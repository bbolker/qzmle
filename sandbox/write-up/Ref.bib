	abstract = {Derivatives play a critical role in computational statistics, examples being Bayesian inference using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling and the training of neural networks. Automatic differentiation is a powerful tool to automate the calculation of derivatives and is preferable to more traditional methods, especially when differentiating complex algorithms and mathematical functions. The implementation of automatic differentiation however requires some care to insure efficiency. Modern differentiation packages deploy a broad range of computational techniques to improve applicability, run time, and memory management. Among these techniques are operation overloading, region based memory, and expression templates. There also exist several mathematical techniques which can yield high performance gains when applied to complex algorithms. For example, semi-analytical derivatives can reduce by orders of magnitude the runtime required to numerically solve and differentiate an algebraic equation. Open problems include the extension of current packages to provide more specialized routines, and efficient methods to perform higher-order differentiation.},

	abstract = {{TMB} is an open source R package that enables quick implementation of complex nonlinear random effect (latent variable) models in a manner similar to the established {AD} Model Builder package ({ADMB}, admb-project.org). In addition, it offers easy access to parallel computations. The user defines the joint likelihood for the data and the random effects as a C++ template function, while all the other operations are done in R; e.g., reading in the data. The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood where the random effects are automatically integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained using automatic differentiation (up to order three) of the joint likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random effects ({\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}6) and parameters ({\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}3). Computation times using {ADMB} and {TMB} are compared on a suite of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the random effects are a Gaussian random field. Speedups ranging from 1.5 to about 100 are obtained with increasing gains for large problems. The package and examples are available at http://tmb-project.org.},

Such settings necessitate the use of methods for derivative-free, or zeroth-order, optimization. We provide a review and perspectives on developments in these methods, with an emphasis on highlighting recent developments and on unifying treatment of such problems in the non-linear optimization and machine learning literature. We categorize methods based on assumed properties of the black-box functions, as well as features of the methods. We first overview the primary setting of deterministic methods applied to unconstrained, non-convex optimization problems where the objective function is defined by a deterministic black-box oracle. We then discuss developments in randomized methods, methods that assume some additional structure about the objective (including convexity, separability and general non-smooth compositions), methods for problems where the output of the black-box oracle is stochastic, and methods for handling different types of constraints.},

	abstract = {Predators can reduce prey density through consumption and induce changes in the phenotypes of surviving prey (e.g. their behavior, morphology, life history). Recent reviews have highlighted the importance of both types of effects for understanding species interactions in food webs. However, most studies focus on only density or trait effects-few have examined both within a single predator–prey system. Here I examine both the density and trait effects of egg-stage predators of the East African reed frog, Hyperolius spinigularis, a species with arboreal clutches and aquatic larvae. To quantify the density effects of egg predators, I monitored seasonal clutch production and survivorship over two breeding seasons and thus estimated the effects of different predators on larval input into the aquatic habitat. I also quantified the effects of egg predators on the timing of hatching and hatchling phenotype. The reed frog, Afrixalus fornasini, and the ephydrid fly, Typopsilopa sp., caused most of the mortality of H. spinigularis eggs, so I focused on these two predators. Egg predation reduced larval densities from 18 to 82\% depending upon the time of the season. Predation by Afrixalus and Typopsilopa caused surviving embryos to hatch 3–4 days earlier, at an earlier developmental stage, and at sizes that were 20–30\% smaller compared to hatchlings from undisturbed clutches. Recent experimental studies in this system have demonstrated that reductions in larval density and size due to egg-stage predators facilitate larval survival in the presence of aquatic predators. Reductions in larval density increase larval survival by reducing larval competition and increasing growth through vulnerable size classes. Predator-induced early-hatched tadpoles exhibited higher larval growth rates than tadpoles from undisturbed clutches, and thus realized higher survival by growing more rapidly though vulnerable size classes. Thus both the density and trait effects of egg-stage predators have important, sometimes unexpected, consequences for survival in subsequent life-stages.},

The operator-overloading approach to performing reverse-mode automatic differentiation is the most convenient for the user but current implementations are typically 10-35 times slower than the original algorithm. In this paper a fast new operator-overloading method is presented that uses the expression template programming technique in C++ to provide a compile-time representation of each mathematical expression as a computational graph that can be efficiently traversed in either direction. Benchmarking with four different numerical algorithms shows this approach to be 2.6--9 times faster than current operator-overloading libraries, and 1.3--7.7 times more efficient in memory usage. It is typically less than 4 times the computational cost of the original algorithm, although poorer performance is found for all libraries in the case of simple loops containing no mathematical functions. An implementation is freely available in the Adept C++ software library.},

The book emphasizes practical, rather than theoretical, aspects of methods for the analysis of diverse types of longitudinal data that can be applied across various fields of study, from the health and medical sciences to the social and behavioral sciences. The authors incorporate their extensive academic and research experience along with various updates that have been made in response to reader feedback. The Second Edition features six newly added chapters that explore topics currently evolving in the field, including:  Fixed effects and mixed effects models Marginal models and generalized estimating equations Approximate methods for generalized linear mixed effects models Multiple imputation and inverse probability weighted methods Smoothing methods for longitudinal data Sample size and power  Each chapter presents methods in the setting of applications to data sets drawn from the health sciences. New problem sets have been added to many chapters, and a related website features sample programs and computer output using {SAS}, Stata, and R, as well as data sets and supplemental slides to facilitate a complete understanding of the material. With its strong emphasis on multidisciplinary applications and the interpretation of results, Applied Longitudinal Analysis, Second Edition is an excellent book for courses on statistics in the health and medical sciences at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. The book also serves as a valuable reference for researchers and professionals in the medical, public health, and pharmaceutical fields as well as those in social and behavioral sciences who would like to learn more about analyzing longitudinal data.},
